TestCoin is a Blockchain implementation made on C#. 
TestCoin demonstrates the fundamentals of Blockchain, including - wallets, key pairs, asymmetric encryption, mining (with dynamic difficultly) and networked nodes (on local network only). This is complimented by an automatic testing platform that allows the user to automate nodes to mine and transact with each other, to simulate a small Blockchain network. This testing platform is customizable and produces performance diagnostics.
